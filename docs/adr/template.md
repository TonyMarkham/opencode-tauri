---

## Context

What is the issue we're addressing? What constraints exist? What requirements drove this decision?

**Universal Constraints (applies to all ADRs):**

- **Zero Custom JavaScript Policy** ([NO_CUSTOM_JAVASCRIPT_POLICY.md](./NO_CUSTOM_JAVASCRIPT_POLICY.md)): Any frontend solution must avoid hand-written JavaScript. Only machine-generated JavaScript (e.g., from framework compilers) is allowed. No `*.js` files to manually maintain. **This is ABSOLUTE.**

- **Thin Tauri Layer Principle** ([ADR-0002](./0002-thin-tauri-layer-principle.md)): Tauri is ONLY for webview hosting. All application logic lives in `client-core`. Ask: "Is this webview hosting? No? → client-core"
