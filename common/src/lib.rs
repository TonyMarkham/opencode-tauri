//! Domain models for OpenCode.
//!
//! This crate contains pure data structures representing the core
//! concepts in our application. Models have no business logic - they're
//! just data that can be passed between layers.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - **models** (this crate): Pure data structures
//! - **client-core**: Business logic operating on models
//! - **opencode**: Application wiring everything together
//!
//! This layered architecture keeps concerns separated and makes testing easier.
